# Image Processing Web App

## Running the app

First, you must run `npm install` in the working directory of the project (the directory with the package.json in it).
Then, to run the server, just run `npm run build` then `npm run dev` in the same directory.

Finally, to interact with the app, use the `index.html` file located in the frontend folder.
You can simply open it in a browser.
